# Algorithms
Various algorithms written in Kotlin

Purpose of this repository is to keep track of the most interesting algorithms i came across during my studies of algorithms. Which I also used to practice my skills in Kotlin.
It's in progress and in future I will add more popular algorithms and data structures.

**Path/Graph searching algorithms are in their own [repository](https://github.com/IgorPidik/Kotlin-SearchAI)**
